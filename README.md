# College_Code
This repository is used to add codes (more are grouped into rar file) aimed at my learning as a Programmer. All my codes will be posted so anyone can analyze and tell me what to improve.
There are, on average, 16 codes in each .rar, which was referenced in a study book. One of the files is normal, as it is an attempt to group several of these codes into one.
